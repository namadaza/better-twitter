Physicists have subsequently performed this same experiment, always withthe same
result, using atoms and molecules, objects trillions of times larger than photons. Physicists
have gone on to prove, thousands of times, that untilmeasured by an intelligent observer,
everything—whether energy such as light,or matter such as atoms—behaves in a wavelike
manner until measured by anintelligent observer. The inescapable conclusion: An intelligent

During the night shift an ambulance brings in a 44-year-old cyanotic,comatose man into the

dentures and put them onto the “crash cart.” After about an hour and a half thepatient has

ventilated and intubated, and he is still comatose. He is transferred to theintensive care unit
to continue the necessary artificial respiration. Onlyafter more than a week do I meet again
with the patient, who is by nowback on the cardiac ward. The moment he sees me he says:
“O, thatnurse knows where my dentures are.” I am very surprised. Then heelucidates: “You
were there when I was brought into hospital and you took my dentures out of my mouth
and put them onto that cart, it had all these bottles on it and there was this sliding drawer
underneath, andthere you put my teeth.” I was especially amazed because I
rememberedthis happening while the man was in deep coma and in the process of CPR. It
appeared that the man had seen himself lying in bed, that he had perceived from above
how nurses and doctors had been busy with theCPR. He was also able to describe
correctly and in detail the small room in which he had been resuscitated as well as the
appearance of thosepresent like myself. He is deeply impressed by his experience and
sayshe is no longer afraid of death.15

The fact is that we are mostly insensible to the world around us. It is safe to say that our
senses simply cannot detect more than 99.9 percent of the wavelengths, frequencies, and
vibrating substances that are actually present. Ifwe could perceive reality fully, the picture
we would have in our minds-eyewould be almost completely different from the picture our
senses allow us toperceive.Matter is a light-show illusion made of vibrating energy.

For some time now it has been thought that only roughly 1.5 to 2 percent ofthe genes in our
DNA are active; the rest are permanently dormant. In the conventional model, the
remaining inactive genes are believed to be theremnants of a long evolutionary process
and no longer useful to us in our current evolutionary state. Recent studies have shown,
however, that we activate and inactivate our own genes routinely—not just in rare cases
like the Overkalixstudy identified.Throughout the course of three months, a group of more
than 30 men withlow-risk prostate cancer, following an intensive nutrition and lifestyle
regimen, upregulated 48 genes that help the body fight tumors and downregulated 453

thousands, of chlorophyll molecules, when transferring the sun’s energy, vibrate in perfect
synchronization with one another. They do so by forming aliquid crystal—that is, they align
in exactly the same way, in exactly the same phase (like rowers stroking in perfect rhythm),
and in exactly the samefrequency. This perfectly coordinated synchrony turns all the
chlorophyllmolecules into a kind of biological superconductor, thereby enabling the superefficient transfer of sunlight quanta from one chlorophyll molecule to the next. The
phenomenon is called resonant energy transfer.

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 15

For example, there are many who know the story about when my father, while on the honor
roll and the eighth-grade class president, was told by his white teacher that his dream to be
a lawyer was unrealistic for a "colored boy." Maybe he should consider carpentry .... He
shared this story with us directly. The teacher actually admired my father greatly and didn't
want to en-courage him to enter a field of study that he believed wouldn't allow my father to excel. Misguided, yet well intended. A teacher crippled by a country that
offered little promise or future for its indigenous and colored inhabitants.

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 47:

this older white boy I knew, Richard Dixon, came up and asked me if I wanted to match
nickels. He had plenty of change for my dollar. In about a half hour, he had all the change
back, including my dollar, and instead of going to town to buy something, I went home with
nothing, and I was bitter. But that was nothing compared to what I felt when I found out
later that he had cheated. There is a way that you can catch and hold the nickel and make
it come up the way you want. This was my first lesson about gambling: if you see
somebody winning all the time, he isn't gambling, he's cheating. Later on in life, if I were
continuously losing in any gambling situation, I would watch very closely. It's like the Negro
in America seeing the white man win all the time. He's a professional gambler; h

I truly believe that if ever a state social agency destroyed a family, it destroyed ours. We
wanted and tried to stay together. Our home didn't have to be destroyed. But the Welfare,
the courts, and their doctor, gave us the one-two-three punch. And ours was not the only
case of this kind. I knew I wouldn't be back to see my mother again because it could make
me a very vicious and dangerous person-knowing how they had looked at us as numbers
and as a case in their book, not as human beings. And knowing that my mother in there
was a statistic that didn't have to be, that existed because of a society's failure, hypocrisy,
greed, and lack of mercy and compassion. Hence I have no mercy or compassion in me for
a society that will crush people, and then penalize them for not being able to stand up

From time to time, Sophia would come over to see me from Boston. Even among Harlem
Negroes, her looks gave me status. They were just like the Negroes everywhere else. That
was why the white prostitutes made so much money. It didn't make any difference if you
were in Lansing, Boston, or New York- what the white racist said, and still says, was right in
those days! All you had to do was put a white girl anywhere close to the average black
man, and he would respond. The black woman also made the white man's eyes light upbut he was slick enough to hide it.

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 140:

I knew we were on the way to a head- shrinker-the Army psychiatrist. The receptionist there
was a Negro nurse. I remember she was in her early twenties, and not bad to look at. She
was one of those Negro "firsts." Negroes know what I'm talking about. Back then, the white
man during the war was so pressed for personnel that he began letting some Negroes put
down their buckets and mops and dust rags and use a pencil, or sit at some desk, or hold
some twenty-five-cent title. You couldn't read the Negro press for the big pictures of smug
black "firsts."

Suddenly, I sprang up and peeped under both doors, the one I'd entered and another that
probably was a closet. And then I bent and whispered fast in his ear. "Daddy-a, now you
and me, we're from up North here, so don't you tell nobody .... I want to get sent down
South. Organize them nigger soldiers, you dig? Steal us some guns, and kill us crackers!"
That psychiatrist's blue pencil dropped, and his professional manner fell off in all directions.
He stared at me as if I were a snake's egg hatching, fumbling for his red pencil. I knew I
had him. I was going back out past Miss First when he said, ''That will be all.'' A 4-F card
came to me in the mail, and I never heard from the Army anymore, and never bothered to
ask why I was re-jected.

I told him and Shorty about some of the things I'd seen. Rudy said that as far as he knew,
Boston had no organized specialty sex houses, just individual rich whites who had their
private specialty desires catered to by Negroes who came to their homes camouflaged as
chauffeurs, maids, waiters, or some other ac- cepted image. Just as in New York, these
were the rich, the highest society-the predominantly old men, past the age of ability to
conduct any kind of ordinary sex, always hunting for new ways to be "sensitive

Even the court clerks and the bailiffs: "Nice white girls ... goddam niggers-" It was the same
even from our court-appointed lawyers as we sat down, under guard, at a table, as our
hearing assembled. Before the judge entered, I said to one lawyer, "We seem to be getting
sentenced because of those girls. ' ' He got red from the neck up and shuffled his papers:
"You had no business with white girls!" Later, when I had learned the full truth about the
white man, I reflected many times that the average burglary sentence for a first offender, as
we all were, was about two years. But we weren't going to get the average-not for our
crime

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 189:

One day in 1948, after I had been transferred to Concord Prison, my brother Philbert, who
was forever joining some- thing, wrote me this time that he had discovered the "natural
religion for the black man.'' He belonged now, he said, to some- thing called "the Nation
oflslam." He said I should "pray to Allah for deliverance.'' I wrote Philbert a letter which,
although in improved English, was worse than my earlier reply to his news that I was being
prayed for by his ''holiness'' church. When a letter from Reginald arrived, I never dreamed
of as-sociating the two letters, although I knew that Reginald had been spending a lot of
time with Wilfred, Hilda, and Philbert in De- troit. Reginald's letter was newsy, and also it
contained this instruction: "Malcolm, don't eat any more pork, and don't smoke any more
cigarettes. I'll show you how to get out of prison."

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 190:

I said to him, "I don't eat pork." The platter then kept on down the table. It was the funniest
thing, the reaction, and the way that it spread. In prison, where so little breaks the
monotonous routine, the smallest thing causes a commotion of talk. It was being mentioned
all over the cell block by night that Satan didn't eat pork. It made me very proud, in some
odd way. One of the universal images of the Negro, in prison and out, was that he couldn't
do without pork. It made me feel good to see that my not eating it had especially startled
the white convicts. Later I would learn, when I had read and studied Islam a good deal,
that, unconsciously, my first pre-Islamic submission had been manifested. I had
experienced, for the first time, the Mus-lim teaching, "If you will take one step toward AllahAllah will take two steps toward you

''The devil has only thirty-three degrees of knowledge-known as Masonry," Reginald said. I
can so specifically re- member the exact phrases since, later, I was going to teach them so
many times to others. "The devil uses his Masonry to rule other people.'' He told me that
this God had come to America, and that he had made himself known to a man named
Elijah-' 'a black man, just like us.'' This God had let Elijah know, Reginald said, that the
devil's "time was up

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 202:

I was to learn later that Elijah Muhammad's tales, like this one of "Yacub," infuriated the
Muslims of the East. While at Mecca, I reminded them that it was their fault, since they
them- selves hadn't done enough to make real Islam known in the West. Their silence left a
vacuum into which any religious faker could step and mislead our people.

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 204:

But bending my knees to pray-that act-well, that took me a week. You know what my life
had been. Picking a lock to rob some- one's house was the only way my knees had ever
been bent before. I had to force myself to bend my knees. And waves of shame and
embarrassment would force me back up. For evil to bend its knees, admitting its guilt, to
implore the forgiveness of God, is the hardest thing in the world. It's easy for me to see and
to say that now. But then, when I was the personification of evil, I was going through it.
Again, again, I would force myself back down into the praying-to-Allah pos-ture. When
finally I was able to make myself stay down-I didn't know what to say to Allah

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 205:

I became increasingly frustrated at not being able to express what I wanted to convey in
letters that I wrote, especially those to Mr. Elijah Muhammad. In the street, I had been the
most articulate hustler out there-I had commanded attention when I said something. But
now, trying to write simple English, I not only wasn't articulate, I wasn't even functional.
How would I sound writing in slang, the way I would say it, something such as, "Look,
daddy, let me pull your coat about a cat, Elijah Muhammad-'' Many who today hear me
somewhere in person, or on tele-vision, or those who read something I've said, will think I
went to school far beyond the eighth grade. This impression is due entirely to my prison
studies.

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 211:

I saw how since the sixteenth century, the so-called "Christian trader" white man began to
ply the seas in his lust for Asian and African empires, and plunder, and power. I read, I saw,
how the white man never has gone among the non-white peoples bearing the Cross in the
true manner and spirit of Christ's teachings-meek, humble, and Christ-like. I perceived, as I
read, how the collective white man had been actually nothing but a piratical opportunist
who used Faustian machinations to make his own Christianity his initial wedge in criminal
conquests. First, always "religiously," he branded "heathen" and "pagan" labels upon
ancient non-white cultures and civilizations. The stage thus set, he then turned upon his
non-white victims his weapons of war.

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 213:

As I see it today, the ability to read awoke inside me some long dormant craving to be
mentally alive. I certainly wasn't seeking any degree, the way a college confers a status
symbol upon its students. My homemade edu-cation gave me, with every additional book
that I read, a little bit more sensitivity to the deafness, dumbness, and blindness that was
afflicting the black race in America. Not long ago, an English writer telephoned me from
London, asking questions. One was, "What's your alma mater?" I told him, "Books." You
will never catch me with a free fifteen minutes in which I'm not studying something I feel
might be able to help the black man

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 214:

Schopenhauer, Kant, Nietzsche, naturally, I read all of those. I don't respect them; I amjust
trying to remember some of those whose theories I soaked up in those years. These three,
it's said, laid the groundwork on which the Fascist and Nazi philosophy was built. I don't
respect them because it seems to me that most of their time was spent arguing about
things that are not really important. They remind me of so many of the Negro ''intellectuals," so-called, with whom I have come in contact-they are always arguing about
something useless.

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 217:

A lot of these black convicts still wouldn't believe it unless they could see that a white man
had said it. So, often, I would read to these brothers selected pas-sages from white men's
books. I'd explain to them that the real truth was known to some white men, the scholars;
but there had been a conspiracy down through the generations to keep the truth from black
men

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 224:

I had come to prison with 20/20 vision. But when I got sent back to Charlestown, I had read
so much by the lights-out glow in my room at the Norfolk Prison Colony that I had
astigmatism and the first pair of the eyeglasses that I have worn ever since.

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 227:

Nothing Down· advertisements drew poor Negroes into that store like flypaper. It was a
shame, the way they paid three and four times what the furniture had cost, because they
could get credit from those Jews. It was the same kind of cheap, gaudy-looking junk that
you can see in any of the black ghetto furniture stores today. Fabrics were stapled on the
sofas. Imitation "leop- ard skin" bedspreads, "tiger skin" rugs, such stuff as that. I would
see clumsy, work-hardened, calloused hands scrawling and scratching signatures on the
contract, agreeing to highway-robbery interest rates in the fine print that never was read.

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 240:

One day, I remember, a dirty glass of water was on a counter and Mr. Muhammad put a
clean glass of water beside it. "You want to know how to spread my teachings?" he said,
and he pointed to the glasses of water. "Don't condemn if you see a person has a dirty
glass of water,'' he said, ''just show them the clean glass of water that you have. When they
inspect it, you won't have to say that yours is better." Of all the things that Mr. Muhammad
ever was to teach me, I don't know why, that still stands out in my mind. Although I haven't
always practiced it. I love too much to battle. I'm in- clined to tell somebody if his glass of
water is dirty.

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 249:

I would raise my hand, for them to be dismissed: ''Do nothing unto anyone that you would
not like to have done unto yourself. Seek peace, and never be the aggressor-but if anyone
attacks you, we do not teach you to turn the other cheek. May Allah bless you to be
successful and victorious in all that you do."

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 250:

I also saw John Hughes, the gambling-house owner, and some others I had known who
were still around Roxbury. The wire about me had made them all uncomfortable, but my
''What you know, Daddy?" approach at least enabled us to have some con-versations. I
never mentioned Islam to most of them. I knew, from what I had been when I was with
them, how brainwashed they were.

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 254:

Our Sunday services were held at two P.M. All over Harlem during the hour or so before
that, Christian church services were dismissing. We by-passed the larger churches with
their higher ratio of so-called "middle-class" Negroes who were so full of pretense and
"status" that they wouldn't be caught in our little storefront. We went "fishing" fast and
furiously when those little evan- gelical storefront churches each let out their thirty to fifty
people on the sidewalk. "Come to hear us, brother, sister-" "You haven't heard anything
until you have heard the teachings of The Honorable Elijah Muhammad-"

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 256:

And don't stop there. In fact, you won't be able to stop for long-his doormen are going to tell
you 'Move on!' But catch a subway and keep on downtown. Anywhere you may want to get
off, look at the white man's apartments, businesses! Go right on down to the tip of
Manhattan Island that this devilish white man ·stole from the trusting Indians for twenty-four
dollars! Look at his City Hall, down there; look at his Wall Street! Look at your- self! Look at
his God!" I had learned early one important thing, and that was to al- ways teach in terms
that the people could understand. Also, where the Nationalists whom we had "fished" were
almost all men, among the storefront Christians, a heavy preponderance were women, and
I had the sense to offer something special for them. "Beautiful black woman! The
Honorable Elijah Muham-mad teaches us that the black man is going around saying he
wants respect; well, the black man never will get anybody's respect until he first learns to
respect his own women! The black man needs today to stand up and throw off the
weaknesses im- posed upon him by the slavemaster white man! The black man needs to
start today to shelter and protect and respect his black women!"

I knew that our strict moral code and discipline was what repelled them most. I fired at this
point, at the reason for our code. "The white man wants black men to stay immoral, unclean and ignorant. As long as we stay in these conditions we will keep on begging him and
he will control us. We never can win freedom and justice and equality until we are doing
some-thing for ourselves!''

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 262:

I ought to explain that each week night a different Muslim class, or event, is scheduled.
Monday night, every temple's Fruit oflslam trains. People think this is just military drill, judo,
karate, things like that-which is part of the F.O.I. training, but only one part. The F.O.I.
spends a lot more time in lectures and discussions on men learning to be men. They deal
with the re- sponsibilities of a husband and father; what to expect of women; the rights of
women which are not to be abrogated by the hus- band; the importance of the father-male
image in the strong household; current events; why honesty, and chastity, are vital in a
person, a home, a community, a nation, and a civilization; why one should bathe at least
once each twenty-four hours; business principles; and things of that nature

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 269:

Two white policemen, breaking up a street scuffle between some Negroes, ordered other
Negro passers-by to "Move on!" Of these bystanders, two happened to be Muslim brother
John-son Hinton and another brother of Temple Seven. They didn't scatter and run the way
the white cops wanted. Brother Hinton was attacked with nightsticks. His scalp was split
open, and a police car came and he was taken to a nearby precinct. The second brother
telephoned our restaurant. And with some telephone calls, in less than half an hour about
fifty of Temple Seven's men of the Fruit of Islam were standing in ranks-formation outside
the police precinct house. Other Negroes, curious, came running, and gathered in excitement behind the Muslims. The police, coming to the station house front door, and
looking out of the windows, couldn't believe what they saw. I went in, as the minister of
Temple Seven, and demanded to see our brother. The police first said he wasn't there.
Then they admitted he was, but said I couldn't see him. I said that until he was seen, and
we were sure he received proper medical attention, the Muslims would remain where they
were. They were nervous and scared of the gathering crowd outside

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 270:

A high police official came up to me, saying "Get those peo-ple out of there.'' I told him that
our brothers were standing peacefully, disciplined perfectly, and hanning no one. He told
me those others, behind them, weren't disciplined. I politely told him those others were his
problemWhen doctors assured us that Brother Hinton was receiving the best of care, I gave
the order and the Muslims slipped away. The other Negroes' mood was ugly, but they
dispersed also, when we left. We wouldn't learn until later that a steel plate would have to
be put into Brother Hinton's skull. (After that operation, the Nation oflslam helped him to
sue; a jury awarded him over $70,000, the largest police brutality judgment that New York
City has ever paid.)

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 276:

The guilty, two-faced white man can't decide what he wants. Our slave foreparents would
have been put to death for advo- cating so-called 'integration' with the white man. Now
when Mr. Muhammad speaks of 'separation,' the white man calls us 'hate-teachers' and
'fascists'

"Mr. Malcolm X," those devils would ask, "why is your Fruit of Islam being trained in judo
and karate?'' An image of black men learning anything suggesting self-defense seemed to
terrify the white man. I'd tum their question around: "Why does judo or karate suddenly get
so ominous because black men study it? Across America, the Boy Scouts, the YMCA, even
the YWCA, the CYP, PAL-they all teach judo! It's all right, it'

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 278:

The reporters would try their utmost to raise some "good" white man whom I couldn't refute
as such. I'll never forget how one practically lost his voice. He asked me did I feel any white
men had ever done anything for the black man in America. I told him, "Yes, I can think of

Hitler put so much pressure on the white man. And then Stalin kept up the pressure

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 298:

If some white man, or "approved" black man, created a nar-cotics cure program as
successful as the one conducted under the aegis of the Muslims, why, there would be

### Autobiography of Malcom X, as Told to Alex Hawley Page 320:

My clue to the Jew's question and challenges is that among all other ethnic groups, his
expressed thinking, his expressed concerns, are the most subjective. And the Jew is
usually hy-persensitive. I mean, you can't even say "Jew" without him accusing you of antiSemitism. I don't care what a Jew is pro-fessionally, doctor, merchant, housewife, student,
or what-ever-first he, or she, thinks Jew, of course I can understand the Jew's
hypersensitivity. For two thousand years, religious and personal prejudices against Jews
have been vented and exercised, as strong as white preju-dices against the non-white. But
I know that America's five and a half million Jews (two million of them are concentrated in
New York) look at it very practically, whether they know it or not: that all of the bigotry and
hatred focused upon the black man keeps off the Jew a lot of heat that would be on him
oth-erwise

Icarus' father made some wings that he fastened with wax. "Never fly but so high with
these wings," the father said. But soaring around, this way, that way, Icarus' flying pleased
him so that he began thinking he was flying on his own merit. Higher, he flew-higher-until
the heat of the sun melted the wax hold-ing those wings. And down came Icarus-tumbling.
Standing there by that Harvard window, I silently vowed to Allah that I never would forget
that any wings I wore had been put on by the religion of Islam. That fact I never have
forgotten

Thy glance fell on me and thou camest down with a smile. I felt that the luck of my life had come at last. Then of a sudden thou didst hold out thy right hand and say “What hast thou to give to me?” Ah, what a kingly jest was it to open thy palm to a beggar to beg! I was confused and stood undecided, and then from my wallet I slowly took out the least little grain of corn and gave it to thee. But how great my surprise when at the day’s end I emptied my bag on the floor to find a least little gram of gold among the poor heap. I bitterly wept and wished that I had had the heart to give thee my all.

The paradox of enlightenment, then, is an attempt to fix a stable relation with what is radically other, since insofar as the other is rigidly positioned within a relation it is no longer fully other.

In one of the awkward alignments of the Cold War, President Richard Nixon had lined up the democratic United States with this authoritarian government, while the despots in the Soviet Union found themselves standing behind democratic India

The onslaught would continue for months. The Dacca consulate stubbornly kept up its reporting. But, Blood later recalled, his cables were met with “a deafening silence.” He was not allowed to protest to the Pakistani authorities. He ratcheted up his dispatches, sending in a blistering cable tagged “Selective Genocide,” urging his bosses to speak out against the atrocities being committed by the Pakistani military. The White House staff passed this up to Kissinger, who paid no heed. Then on April 6, two weeks into the slaughter, Blood and almost his entire consulate sent in a telegram formally declaring their “strong dissent”—a total repudiation of the policy that they were there to carry out. That cable—perhaps the most radical rejection of U.S. policy ever sent by its diplomats—blasted the United States for silence in the face of atrocities, for not denouncing the quashing of democracy, for showing “moral bankruptcy” in the face of what they bluntly called genocide.

### The Blood Telegram, by Gary J Bass - Page 11

As Pakistan’s most important international backer, the U.S. had great influence but failed to use its leverage, as Nixon and Kissinger chose not to warn against violence, impose conditions, threaten sanctions, challenge the military’s suppression of democratic results, or demand restraint in using U.S. weaponry, offering neither public condemnation nor private deterrence.

### The Blood Telegram, by Gary J Bass - Page 12

Nixon and Kissinger drove South Asia policy with energy and creativity—but mainly to silence dissenters like Blood and fuel their hostility toward India, showing neither admiration for its democracy nor appreciation of its geopolitical importance, instead resorting to crude, personal vitriol, often letting emotion override their famed realpolitik.

### The Blood Telegram, by Gary J Bass - Page 16

Americans reacted with horror as media exposed the atrocities, sparking public outrage and congressional opposition, led by Edward Kennedy, which ultimately forced the White House to curb its unwavering support for Pakistan, despite Kissinger’s desire to escalate arms sales.

### The Blood Telegram, by Gary J Bass - Page 17

The State Department outmaneuvered Nixon and Kissinger by quietly blocking U.S. arms shipments to Pakistan, prompting the enraged duo to retaliate by attempting to fire or demote key dissenters like Blood and Keating.

India’s most striking policy was what it didn’t do—it did not stop the massive influx of Bengali refugees, ultimately providing safety to up to ten million people, five times the number displaced in Bosnia in the 1990s.

In Comilla, they collaborated with Akhtar Hameed Khan, whose pioneering work in agricultural cooperatives and microfinance helped lay the groundwork for Muhammad Yunus and Grameen Bank, later awarded the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for their microcredit efforts, while Blood’s officials took pride in their professionalism and dedication.

“It was so emerald green it almost hurt your eyes,” he recalls, describing the sweltering June 1969 heat, the swampy, tropical air, and the stunning landscape of rice paddies and rivers, where dhows with tattered sails seemed to glide through the fields, though they were miles away.

Mujib condensed Bengali nationalist grievances into the “Six Points,” demanding democracy and near-total autonomy for East Pakistan, allowing it to handle trade, aid, and even raise its own militia, while the central government controlled only foreign affairs and defense; he personally led cyclone relief efforts, accused the Pakistani government of murder, and confidently told Blood he would sweep nearly every seat in East Pakistan.

### The Blood Telegram, by Gary J Bass - Page 48

The White House showed little interest in upholding Pakistan’s democratic experiment, fearing the loss of a Cold War ally, while the State Department worried about Pakistan’s potential collapse; when Kissinger suggested warming up to Mujib, Nixon, loyal to Yahya, dismissed the idea, writing, “not yet” and “not any position which encourages secession.”

### The Blood Telegram, by Gary J Bass - Page 119

The Bengali insurgents, first called the Mukti Fouj (Liberation Brigade) and later the Mukti Bahini (Liberation Army), fought back by targeting roads and bridges, while Pakistan sought to crush the resistance before the monsoon or push them into India; a Bengali rebel declared, “We are just waiting for the monsoon—we are masters of water.”

### The Blood Telegram, by Gary J Bass - Page 140

Kissinger believed in leveraging power over other governments, telling Nixon that “pressure gets you to places, or the potentiality of pressure,” and asserting that no one had ever helped the U.S. out of goodwill.

### The Blood Telegram, by Gary J Bass - Page 140

Kissinger suggested aiding Yahya in negotiating a settlement to the war, which, while appearing moderate on paper with pro-Pakistan and pro-Bengali alternatives, effectively signified strong support for Yahya.

### The Blood Telegram, by Gary J Bass - Page 142

Kissinger incited Nixon's anger, claiming that leaks were weakening the administration and threatening foreign policy; Nixon, viewing it as a conspiracy, declared to H. R. Haldeman that they would use any means necessary, leading him to form a team called the Plumbers to track down leakers and order break-ins at the Brookings Institution and Ellsberg's psychiatrist’s office for a smear campaign, insisting, “You can’t let the Jew steal that stuff and get away with it.”

### The Blood Telegram, by Gary J Bass - Page 164

The Pakistani government initially rejected international relief, with Yahya only agreeing to let the United Nations provide humanitarian assistance in late May; the UN's high commissioner for refugees, Prince Sadruddin Khan, who had a close relationship with Yahya, was skeptical of India’s motives and believed they were exaggerating the refugee crisis.

In a surprising turn, Israel, which India did not officially recognize and whose leaders were often frosty toward it, secretly supplied India with mortars, ammunition, and instructors in July, following a request for support from Haksar, with Prime Minister Golda Meir promising to continue assistance.

The next day in the Oval Office, Kissinger expressed frustration to Nixon about Keating's almost fanatical stance on the issue, while Nixon resented having to meet with him, believing that Keating had become too influenced by his environment, remarking, “Keating, like every ambassador who goes over there, gets sucked in.”

### The Blood Telegram, by Gary J Bass - Page 180

Kissinger condemned the Indians, questioning why the U.S. should get involved in the “morass of East Pakistan” when they had never helped America, and he dismissed the future of Bangladesh before it even existed, predicting it would become a cesspool with a population of 100 million, the lowest standard of living in Asia, and no resources, making it susceptible to Communist infiltration.

Kissinger spent the next day enduring a series of brutal meetings, facing denunciations and provocations from both official and unofficial Indian sources, while also battling illness as patriotic Indian microbes took their toll; his planned ruse of feigning an upset stomach became reality, forcing him to suffer silently in Delhi while trying to maintain his cover story.

They were excellent swimmers familiar with the terrain, allowing for effective attacks on locations like Chittagong; “Surprise was the most important thing,” one operative explained, emphasizing the need for a major initial strike on a moonless night, using infiltrated Bengalis to avoid detection. With around two hundred frogmen conducting strikes across East Pakistan, Richard Nixon expressed frustration over the Indians destroying boats, while Roy noted that Lloyd’s of London estimated they had damaged one hundred thousand tons of shipping, effectively halting port activity.

### The Blood Telegram, by Gary J Bass - Page 211

In desperation, the rebels resorted to using children as soldiers, a fact widely recognized; a few months later, Indira Gandhi praised the bravery of “young boys of even 12 years of age who joined the Mukti Bahini” in a Delhi speech, and in a major address to Parliament, she commended the “brave young men and boys of the Mukti Bahini for their valour and dedication.”

The Indian government established youth training camps for children and older youths, beginning with political indoctrination followed by four to six weeks of guerrilla warfare training before sending them into battle; many camps were supervised by the Awami League and managed by India’s Border Security Force, with military training provided by the Indian army.

In June, the chief minister of West Bengal lamented that the state was overwhelmed with millions fleeing Pakistan’s oppression; his unstable government collapsed later that month, leading to central rule imposed by Gandhi’s government. He warned that the refugee crisis was a boon for communist and Naxalite revolutionaries, who were ready to exploit the suffering of the refugees, preying on their “dejected, desolate minds.”

### The Blood Telegram, by Gary J Bass - Page 222

India is viewed with suspicion in the West for opposing imperialism and for “inventing” the concept of the Third World, while being distrusted in the Third World due to its subversive sentiments toward democracy and human rights; the Muslim world resents India’s secularism, and communist nations see it as insolent and potentially dangerous for rejecting communism as a prerequisite for progress. Ultimately, the question remains: while we claim to be on the side of God, is God on our side?

Nixon’s policy “baffles me,” and he defended democratic principles, calling it a “travesty” that Mujib, the Awami League leader, faced trial in a secret military court, asserting that “the only crime that Mujib is guilty of is winning an election.”

Henry Kissinger has cultivated an image of being supremely coolheaded in a crisis—the ideal person to receive a 3 a.m. phone call—but to Nixon and his senior team, he appeared to be coming unglued, exhausted from managing the China opening and the Vietnam War. After months of trying to prevent a major conflict, he had failed; his voice was strained, which Nixon attributed to tension, and he seemed increasingly irrational.

Determined to reach Dacca, Indian troops captured only two major towns, Jessore and Comilla, opting for dirt roads and fields instead of highways to avoid becoming easy targets, aided by the Mukti Bahini’s expert knowledge of the local riverine terrain; in a bombed-out school, an Indian officer told Sydney Schanberg of the New York Times, “We are kicking the shit out of them.”

### The Blood Telegram, by Gary J Bass - Page 316

In Washington, Nixon and Kissinger typically dismissed the United Nations with contempt, but once the war began, they recognized its potential as a tool against India; by persuading the UN Security Council to demand a withdrawal of all troops, they aimed to deny India its battlefield victory, with Nixon remarking, “the Indians are susceptible to this world public opinion crap.”

All the legends agree on this point: that Kabîr was a weaver, a simple and unlettered man, who earned his living at the loom. Like Paul the tentmaker, Boehme the cobbler, Bunyan the tinker, Tersteegen the ribbon-maker, he knew how to combine vision and industry; the work of his hands helped rather than hindered the impassioned meditation of his heart. Hating mere bodily austerities, he was no ascetic, but a married man, the father of a family—a circumstance which Hindu legends of the monastic type vainly attempt to conceal or explain—and it was from out of the heart of the common life that he sang his rapturous lyrics of divine love.

But Sikandar Lodi, a ruler of considerable culture, was tolerant of the eccentricities of saintly persons belonging to his own faith. Kabîr, being of Mohammedan birth, was outside the authority of the Brâhmans, and technically classed with the Sûfîs, to whom great theological latitude was allowed.

### Songs of Kabir, by Tagore - II > Page 16 · Location 143

But Kabîr says that Brahma and the creature are "ever distinct, yet ever united"; that the wise man knows the spiritual as well as the material world to "be no more than His footstool." [Footnote: Nos. VII and IX.] The soul's union with Him is a love union, a mutual inhabitation; that essentially dualistic relation which all mystical religion expresses, not a self-mergence which leaves no place for personality. This eternal distinction, the mysterious union-in-separateness of God and the soul, is a necessary doctrine of all sane mysticism; for no scheme which fails to find a place for it can represent more than a fragment of that soul's intercourse with the spiritual world.

### Songs of Kabir, by Tagore - II > Page 19 · Location 185

Yet in this wide and rapturous vision of the universe Kabîr never loses touch with diurnal existence, never forgets the common life. His feet are firmly planted upon earth; his lofty and passionate apprehensions are perpetually controlled by the activity of a sane and vigorous intellect, by the alert commonsense so often found in persons of real mystical genius. The constant insistence on simplicity and directness, the hatred of all abstractions and philosophizings,[ Footnote: Nos. XXVI, XXXII, LXXVI] the ruthless criticism of external religion: these are amongst his most marked characteristics.

Lay hold on your sword, and join in the fight. Fight, O my brother, as long as life lasts. Strike off your enemy's head, and there make an end of him quickly: then come, and bow your head at your King's Durbar. He who is brave, never forsakes the battle: he who flies from it is no true fighter. In the field of this body a great war goes forward, against passion, anger, pride, and greed: It is in the kingdom of truth, contentment and purity, that this battle is raging; and the sword that rings forth most loudly is the sword of His Name. Kabîr says: "When a brave knight takes the field, a host of cowards is put to flight. It is a hard fight and a weary one, this fight of the truth-seeker: for the vow of the truth-seeker is more hard than that of the warrior, or of the widowed wife who would follow her husband. For the warrior fights for a few hours, and the widow's struggle with death is soon ended: But the truth-seeker's battle goes on day and night, as long as life lasts it never ceases."

The Hidden Banner is planted in the temple of the sky; there the blue canopy decked with the moon and set with bright jewels is spread.

Sharia establishes the interdict of gharar, drastic enough to be totally banned in any form of transaction. It is an extremely sophisticated term in decision theory that does not exist in English; it means both uncertainty and deception—my personal take is that it means something beyond informational asymmetry between agents: inequality of uncertainty. Simply, as the aim is for both parties in a transaction to have the same uncertainty facing random outcomes, an asymmetry becomes equivalent to theft. Or more robustly: No person in a transaction should have certainty about the outcome while the other one has uncertainty.

But the doctor is pressured to treat you to protect himself. Should you drop dead a few weeks after the visit, a low probability event, the doctor can be sued for negligence, for not having prescribed the right medicine that is temporarily believed to be useful (as in the case of statins), but that we now know has been backed up by suspicious or incomplete studies.

Hannibal terrorized Rome for a decade and a half with a tiny army of mercenaries, winning twenty-two battles against the Romans, battles in which he was outnumbered each time. He was inspired by a version of this maxim.

The vulnerability of heads of households has been remarkably exploited in history. The samurai had to leave their families in Edo as hostages, thus guaranteeing to the authorities that they would not take positions against the rulers. The Romans and Huns partook of the practice of exchanging permanent “visitors,” the children of rulers on both sides, who grew up at the courts of the foreign nation in a form of gilded captivity. The Ottomans relied on janissaries, who were extracted as babies from Christian families and never married. Having no family (or no contact with their family), they were entirely devoted to the sultan.

The policies of the Soviet authorities and their understanding of the “inferiority” of Muslim women as a “surrogate proletariat” would lead them to see in them a revolutionary potential that could overturn “traditional” authority in Muslim societies which lacked an industrial male, let alone a female, proletariat.

It is the position of women in the West and inside Christianity that is fantasized and fictionalized as one of equality, and that, indeed, violations of such equality, “rare” as they are, are always already noncultural and nonreligious aberrations. Part of the ongoing self-making of the West today is its projection and championing of itself on account of the (fictional) equal position of its women with its men, which must always be contrasted primarily with the position of Muslim women of the East and especially in “Islam.”

Depending on particular [European] national histories, the idealization of the nation has taken various forms. In France it has taken the form of an insistence on the values and beliefs of the republic, said to be the realization of the principles of the Enlightenment in their highest, most enduring form. This image of France is mythical; its power and appeal rests, to a large degree, on its negative portrayal of Islam.

The ascendance of “rights” discourse took place at the dawn of the neoliberal global order and would coincide with the weakening of the USSR and its ultimate collapse.

The institutionalization of neoliberalism through US-dictated local economic legislation inside the United States was and is imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on Third World countries, and more recently on some European countries as well. This is coupled with the proliferation of Western-funded nongovernmental organizations propounding neoliberal arrangements of economic and social opportunities that protect and enshrine “human” and property rights and often ignore or downplay economic and social rights, all the while presenting themselves as, while supplanting, local “civil society” and the state’s social welfare function.

gender violence, which is a relative newcomer to the category of human rights violations, has become, since the 1990s, “the centerpiece of women’s human rights,” with specialized, highly funded NGOs and world conferences convening in the 1980s and 1990s

The conflict was therefore between Euro-American and West European imperial and liberal culture that redefined itself in relation to women in the 1970s and 1980s and non-European cultures that had not done so, or at least had not done so in the same way.

Why is there so little disagreement among these presidential hopefuls regarding Israel, when there are profound disagreements among them on almost every other important issue facing the United States and when it is apparent that America’s Middle East policy has gone badly awry?

Now that the Cold War is over, Israel has become a strategic liability for the United States.

### The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy by Mearsheimer - Page 5 · Location 198

The real reason why American politicians are so deferential is the political power of the Israel lobby. The lobby is a loose coalition of individuals and organizations that actively works to move U.S. foreign policy in a pro-Israel direction.

### The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy by Mearsheimer - Page 5 · Location 204

Like the efforts of other ethnic lobbies and interest groups, the activities of the Israel lobby’s various elements are legitimate forms of democratic political participation, and they are for the most part consistent with America’s long tradition of interest group activity.

Between the routing of the Barbary pirates two hundred years ago and World War II, the United States played no significant security role anywhere in the region and U.S. leaders did not aspire to one.

Woodrow Wilson did endorse the 1917 Balfour Declaration (which expressed Britain’s support for the creation of a Jewish homeland in Palestine), but Wilson did virtually nothing to advance this goal.

The United States has played an important and steadily increasing role in Middle East security issues since World War II, driven initially by oil, then by anticommunism and, over time, by its growing relationship with Israel.

### The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy by Mearsheimer - Page 7 · Location 240

makes little sense to try to explain current U.S. policy—and especially the lavish support that is now given to Israel—by referring to the religious beliefs of a bygone era or the radically different forms of past American engagement.

Another example is the Bush administration’s behavior during Israel’s war against Lebanon in the summer of 2006. Almost every country in the world harshly criticized Israel’s bombing campaign—a campaign that killed more than one thousand Lebanese, most of them civilians—but the United States did not. Instead, it helped Israel prosecute the war, with prominent members of both political parties openly defending Israel’s behavior.

### The Israel lobby has successfully convinced many Americans that American and Israeli interests are essentially identical. In fact, they are not.

Because the United States is a pluralist democracy where freedom of speech and association are guaranteed, it was inevitable that interest groups would come to dominate the political process.

an examination of Israel’s policies and the efforts of its American supporters does not imply an anti-Israel bias, just as an examination of the political activities of the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) does not imply bias against older citizens.

A key element of such anti-Semitic accusations is the claim that Jews exercise illegitimate influence by “controlling” banks, the media, and other key institutions. Thus, if someone says that press coverage in the United States tends to favor Israel over its opponents, this may sound to some like the old canard that “Jews control the media.”

In addition to direct lobbying on Capitol Hill, the lobby rewards or punishes politicians largely through an ability to guide the flow of campaign contributions.

The September 11 attacks had a profound impact on the Bush administration’s foreign policy and the decision to topple Saddam Hussein. But absent the lobby’s influence, there almost certainly would not have been a war.

We argue that Israel’s response to Hezbollah’s unjustified provocation in the summer of 2006 was both strategically foolish and morally wrong, yet the lobby’s influence made it hard for U.S. officials to do anything except strongly back Israel. This case offers yet another classic illustration of the lobby’s regrettable influence on American and Israeli interests: by making it hard for U.S. policy makers to step back and give their Israeli counterparts honest and critical advice, the lobby facilitated a policy that further tarnished America’s image, weakened the democratically elected regime in Beirut, and strengthened Hezbollah.

As of 2005, direct U.S. economic and military assistance to Israel amounted to nearly $ 154 billion (in 2005 dollars), the bulk of it comprising direct grants rather than loans. 2

it is easy to forget that the “special relationship” that now exists did not emerge until several decades after Israel’s founding.

both the Truman and Eisenhower administrations also realized that embracing Israel too closely would jeopardize relations with the Arab world and provide the Soviet Union with enticing opportunities to gain influence in the Middle East. Accordingly, the United States sought to steer a middle course between Israel and its Arab neighbors during the 1950s; economic aid to Israel was modest and the United States provided hardly any direct military assistance. 3 Israeli requests to purchase American weaponry were politely rejected, as were requests for a U.S. security guarantee.

### The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy by Mearsheimer - Chapter 1 - The Great Benefactor > Page 24 · Location 549

Similar threats to halt American aid played a key role in convincing Israel to withdraw from the territory it had seized from Egypt in the 1956 Suez War.

After averaging roughly $ 63 million annually from 1949 to 1965 (more than 95 percent of which was economic assistance and food aid), average aid increased to $ 102 million per year from 1966 to 1970. Support soared to $ 634.5 million in 1971 (roughly 85 percent was military assistance)

### The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy by Mearsheimer - Chapter 1 - The Great Benefactor > Page 26 · Location 576

Israel became the largest annual recipient of U.S. foreign assistance in 1976, a position it has retained ever since.

### The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy by Mearsheimer - Chapter 1 - The Great Benefactor > Page 26 · Location 583

Israel now receives on average about $ 3 billion in direct foreign assistance each year, an amount that is roughly one-sixth of America’s direct foreign assistance budget and equal to about 2 percent of Israel’s GDP.

since 1982, the annual foreign aid bill has included a special clause specifying that Israel is to receive its entire annual appropriation in the first thirty days of the fiscal year.

transferring the aid all at once requires it to borrow the necessary amount of money up front, and the CRS estimates that it costs U.S. taxpayers “between $ 50 and $ 60 million per year to borrow funds for the early, lump-sum payment.” 19

the FMF program normally requires recipients of U.S. military assistance to spend all of the money here in the United States, to help keep American defense workers employed. Congress grants Israel a special exemption in the annual appropriations bill, however, authorizing it to use about one out of every four U.S. military aid dollars to subsidize its own defense industry.

Egypt and Jordan are the number two and three recipients of U.S. foreign aid, but most of this money should be seen as a reward for good behavior—specifically, their willingness to sign peace treaties with Israel. Egypt received $ 71.7 million in U.S. aid in 1974, but it got $ 1.127 billion in 1975 and $ 1.320 billion in 1976 (in constant 2005 dollars) following completion of the Sinai II disengagement agreement.

Similarly, Jordan received $ 76 million in direct aid in 1994 and only $ 57 million in 1995, but Congress rewarded King Hussein’s decision to sign a peace treaty in 1994 by forgiving Jordan’s $ 700 million debt to the United States and removing other restrictions on U.S. aid.

Josiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with three children into New England, about 1682. The conventicles having been forbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced some considerable men of his acquaintance to remove to that country, and he was prevailed with to accompany them thither, where they expected to enjoy their mode of religion with freedom.

### Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin - Page 25 · Location 287

At his table he liked to have, as often as he could, some sensible friend or neighbor to converse with, and always took care to start some ingenious or useful topic for discourse, which might tend to improve the minds of his children.

By this means he turned our attention to what was good, just, and prudent in the conduct of life; and little or no notice was ever taken of what related to the victuals on the table, whether it was well or ill dressed, in or out of season, of good or bad flavor, preferable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind, so that I was brought up in such a perfect inattention to those matters as to be quite indifferent what kind of food was set before me, and so unobservant of it, that to this day if I am asked I can scarce tell a few hours after dinner what I dined upon. This has been a convenience to me in traveling, where my companions have been sometimes very unhappy for want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate, because better instructed, tastes and appetites.

But my dislike to the trade continuing, my father was under apprehensions that if he did not find one for me more agreeable, I should break away and get to sea, as his son Josiah had done, to his great vexation. He therefore sometimes took me to walk with him, and see joiners, bricklayers, turners, braziers, etc., at their work, that he might observe my inclination, and endeavor to fix it on some trade or other on land. It has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmen handle their tools;

I continued this method some few years, but gradually left it, retaining only the habit of expressing myself in terms of modest diffidence; never using, when I advanced anything that may possibly be disputed, the words “certainly,” “undoubtedly,” or any others that give the air of positiveness to an opinion; but rather say, I conceive or apprehend a thing to be so-and-so; it appears to me, or I should think it so or so, for such and such reasons; or I imagine it to be so; or it is so, if I am not mistaken. This habit, I believe, has been of great advantage to me when I have had occasion to inculcate my opinions, and persuade men into measures that I have been from time to time engaged in promoting; and, as the chief ends of conversation are to inform or to be informed, to please or to persuade, I wish well-meaning, sensible men would not lessen their power of doing good by a positive, assuming manner, that seldom fails to disgust, tends to create opposition, and to defeat every one of those purposes for which speech was given to us, to wit, giving or receiving information or pleasure.

Our debates possessed me so fully of the subject, that I wrote and printed an anonymous pamphlet on it, entitled “The Nature and Necessity of a Paper Currency.” It was well received by the common people in general; but the rich men disliked it, for it increased and strengthened the clamor for more money, and they happening to have no writers among them that were able to answer it, their opposition slackened, and the point was carried by a majority in the House. My friends there, who conceived I had been of some service, thought fit to reward me by employing me in printing the money; a very profitable job and a great help to me. This was another advantage gained by my being able to write.

I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight, and stated it as a scheme of a number of friends, who had requested me to go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading. In this way my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever after practised it on such occasions; and, from my frequent successes, can heartily recommend it.

Still, I do not feel that the West has really become less condescending toward foreign cultures than the Greeks and Romans were: it has only become more tolerant.

Because he a priori admits this impossibility, he is able to contemplate such really alien cultures with equanimity and often with sympathetic appreciation.

Well, are nations and civilizations anything but collective individuals? Their development also is bound up with the experiences of their early childhood. As with children, those experiences may have been pleasant or unpleasant; they may have been perfectly rational or, alternatively, due to the child's naive misinterpretation of an event: the moulding effect of every such experience depends primarily on its original intensity.

Europe received its most formidable shock - in modern parlance, a 'trauma' - in the shape of the Crusades. The Crusades were the strongest collective impression on a civilization that had just begun to be conscious of itself.

Nothing that Europe has experienced before or after could compare with the enthusiasm which the First Crusade brought into being.

Its great simplicity has vanished and, with it, much that was humanly unique. It is with the pain one feels for something precious, now irretrievably lost, that I remember that last, long desert trek, when we rode, rode, two men on two dromedaries, through swimming light

Opium is bad - there can be no doubt about it - for it awakens in man a craving for unattainable things; it makes his dreams greedy, like those of an animal. But hashish silences all greed and makes one indifferent to all things of the world. That's it: it makes one contented. You could place a mound of gold before a hashshashi - not just while he is smoking, but at any time - and he would not even stretch out his little finger for it.

coffee is freshly roasted for every pot. As soon as the beans are lightly tanned, he places them in a brass mortar and pounds them. Thereupon he pours some of the boiling water from the larger pot into the smaller, empties the ground coffee into it and places the pot near the fire to let it slowly simmer. When the brew is almost ready, he adds a few cardamon seeds to make it more bitter, for, as the saying goes in Arabia, coffee, in order to be good, must be 'bitter like death and hot like love'.

And it occurred to only very few of us that the cause of all this confusion might lie perhaps in the arbitrariness of the self-righteous guardians of faith who claimed to have the right to 'define' God and, by clothing Him with their own garments, separated Him from man and his destiny.

years, I feel that the young men and women who spoke and wrote with so much enthusiasm about 'the body's freedom' were very far indeed from the ebullient spirit of Pan they so often invoked: their raptures were too self-conscious to be exuberant, and too easy-going to be revolutionary.

No doubt there were still many individuals who felt and thought in religious terms and made the most desperate efforts to reconcile their moral beliefs with the spirit of their civilization, but they were only exceptions.

The average European - whether democrat or communist, manual worker or intellectual - seemed to know only one positive faith: the worship of material progress, the belief that there could be no other goal in life than to make that very life continually easier or, as the current expression went, 'independent of nature'.

You, like so many others, are living in an illusion which is thousands of years old: the illusion that intellect alone can give a direction to man's striving. But the intellect cannot reach spiritual knowledge by itself because it is too much absorbed in the achievement of material goals; it is faith, and faith alone, that can release us from such an absorption.'

Jews from Poland and Russia, who seemed to carry with them so much of the smallness and narrowness of their past lives in Europe that it was surprising to think they claimed to be of the same stock as the proud Jew from Morocco or Tunisia in his white burnus. But although the European Jews were so obviously out of all harmony with the picture that surrounded them, it was they who set the tone of Jewish life and politics and thus seemed to be responsible for the almost visible friction between Jews and Arabs.

After all, the Hebrews also came as conquerors to Palestine. Long before them were many other Semitic and non-Semitic tribes settled here - the Amorites, the Edomites, the Philistines, the Moabites, and the Hittites.

A man of deep religious convictions - as 'orthodox' as any Jew of Eastern Europe - he did not approve of the idea of Zionism, for he believed that the return of his people to the Promised Land had to await the coming of the Messiah. 'We Jews,' he said to me on more than one occasion, 'were driven away from the Holy Land and scattered all over the world because we had fallen short of the task God had conferred upon us. We had been chosen by Him to preach His Word, but in our stubborn pride we began to believe that He had made us a "chosen nation" for our own sakes - and thus we betrayed Him. Now nothing remains for us but to repent and to cleanse our hearts; and when we become worthy once again to be the hearers of His Message, He will send a Messiah to lead His servants back to the Promised Land ...'

The two thousand years of Jewish exile and unhappiness have taught them nothing. Instead of making an attempt to understand the innermost causes of our unhappiness, they now try to circumvent it, as it were, by building a "national home" on foundations provided by Western power politics; and in the process of building a national home, they are committing the crime of depriving another people of its home.'

In result, he has not progressed in material achievement as rapidly as the Westerner - but he has kept his soul together.

Islam did not seem to be so much a religion in the popular sense of the word as, rather, a way of life; not so much a system of theology as a programme of personal and social behaviour based on the consciousness of God.

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

No asceticism was required to open a hidden gate to purity:

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

purity was man's birthright, and sin meant no more than a lapse from the innate, positive qualities with which God was said to have endowed every human being.

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

Christianity, I felt, had long ceased to provide a moral impetus to Western civilization. Its adherents had grown accustomed to the idea that it was not the business of religion to 'interfere' with practical life; they were content to regard religious faith as a soothing convention, meant to foster no more than a vague sense of personal morality - especially sexual morality - in individual men and women.

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

My instinctive, youthful conviction that 'man does not live by bread alone' crystallized into the intellectual conviction that the current adoration of 'progress' was no more than a weak, shadowy substitute for an earlier faith in absolute values - a pseudo-faith devised by people who had lost all inner strength to believe in absolute values and were now deluding themselves with the belief that somehow, by mere evolutionary impulse, man would outgrow his present difficulties

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

Our feeling of exclusion rests mainly on an error peculiar to our Western way of thinking: we are wont to underestimate the creative value of the unfamiliar and are always tempted to do violence to it, to appropriate it, to take it over, on our own terms, into our own intellectual environment.

It was from a burning thornbush in the desert of Midian that the voice of God rang out to Moses; it was in the wilderness of the Judean desert that Jesus received the message of the Kingdom of God; and it was in the cave of Hira, in the desert hills near Mecca, that the first call came to Muhammad of Arabia.

Harut and Marut, who forgot to be humble, as it behoves angels to be, and boasted of their invincible purity: 'We are made of light; we are above all sin and desire, unlike the weak sons of man, sons of a mother's dark womb.' But they forgot that their purity had not come from their own strength, for they were pure only because they knew no desire and had never been called upon to resist it.

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

Choose between punishment in this world and punishment in the Hereafter.' In their bitter remorse, the fallen angels chose punishment in this world: and the Lord ordained that they be suspended on chains between heaven and earth and remain thus suspended until the Day of Judgment as a warning to angels and men that all virtue destroys itself if it loses humility.

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

Harut and Marut is a typical creation of the Muslim mind, an illustration of the idea that abstract purity, or freedom from sin, can have no moral meaning so long as it is based on a mere absence of urges and desires:

the problem for man is not how to suppress the demands of his body but, rather, how to co-ordinate them with the demands of his spirit in such a way that life might become full and righteous.

It is a tragic quality of the Arabs that they must always swing between two poles and never can find a middle way. Once upon a time - hardly two centuries ago - the Arabs of Najd were innerly more distant from Islam than any other group in the Muslim world; while ever since the advent of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab they have regarded themselves not merely as champions of the Faith but almost as its sole owners.

In the next moment Ibn Saud stood in the doorway. Naturally, I wanted to rise, but old Abd ar-Rahman gripped me by the wrist and pulled me down, as if to say, 'Thou art my guest.' I was embarrassed beyond words at thus having to remain seated while the King, after greeting his father from afar, was left standing in the doorway, obviously awaiting permission to enter the room, but he must have been accustomed to similar whimsies on his father's part, for he winked at me with a half-smile to put me at ease.

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

What I saw in the pages of the Koran was not a 'crudely materialistic' world-view but, on the contrary, an intense God-consciousness that expressed itself in a rational acceptance of all God-created nature: a harmonious side-by-side of intellect and sensual urge, spiritual need and social demand.

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

It was not the Muslims that had made Islam great: it was Islam that had made the Muslims great. But as soon as their faith became habit and ceased to be a programme of life, to be consciously pursued, the creative impulse that underlay their civilization waned and gradually gave way to indolence, sterility and cultural decay.

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

Only very few people - only prophets - are really able to understand the inner voice that speaks in them. Most of us are trammelled by our personal interests and desires - and if everyone were to follow only what his own heart dictates, we would have complete moral chaos and could never agree on any mode of behaviour.

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

The speculations of the sūfis, as the Muslim mystics were called, betrayed Gnostic, Indian and occasionally even Christian influences which had brought in ascetic concepts and practices entirely alien to the message of the Arabian Prophet. In his message, reason was stressed as the only real way to faith. While the validity of mystical experience was not necessarily precluded in this approach, Islam was primarily an intellectual and not an emotional proposition.

for emotions, however profound, are far more liable to be swayed by subjective desires and fears than reason, with all its fallibility, ever could be.

And then I saw what I had not observed before: many, very many people were smoking opium, some of them more and others less publicly. The shopkeeper in his niche; the loafer under the arched gateway of a caravanserai; the coppersmith in his workshop during a moment of respite: they all were smoking with the same withdrawn, somewhat tired face, gazing with dull eyes into a spaceless void...

their religious feeling itself, so unlike that of the Arabs, bore a strong tinge of sadness and mourning: to weep over the tragic happenings of thirteen centuries ago - to weep over the deaths of Ali, the Prophet's son-in-law, and Ali's two sons, Hasan and Husayn - seemed to them more important than to consider what Islam stood for and what direction it wanted to give to men's lives...

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

Was it the innate melancholy of the Iranians and their sense of the dramatic that had caused them to embrace the Shia doctrine? - or was it the tragic quality of the latter's origin that had led to this intense Iranian melancholy?

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

In spite of their speedy and apparently voluntary acceptance of the new religion, they subconsciously equated the victory of the Islamic idea with Iran's national defeat;

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

the Iranians' first - and, in a way, most durable - reaction to it was one of deep humiliation and repressed resentment.

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

They did it by subtly transforming the rational, unmystical God-consciousness of the Arabs into its very opposite: mystical fanaticism and sombre emotion.

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

The Islamic principle of God's ungraspable transcendency was transfigured into the mystical doctrine (for which there were many precedents in pre-Islamic Iran) of God's physical manifestation in especially chosen mortals who would transmit this divine essence to their descendants.

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

the Shia doctrine offered a most welcome channel: for there could be no doubt that the Shiite veneration, almost deification, of Ali and his descendants concealed the germ of the idea of God's incarnation and continual reincarnation - an idea entirely alien to Islam but very close to the Iranian heart. It had been no accident that the Prophet Muhammad died without having nominated a successor and, indeed, refused to nominate one when a suggestion to that effect was made shortly before his death. By his attitude he intended to convey, firstly, that the spiritual quality of Prophethood was not something that could be 'inherited', and, secondly, that the future leadership of the community should be the outcome of free election by the people themselves and not of an 'ordination' by the Prophet (which would naturally have been implied in his designation of a successor): and thus he deliberately ruled out the idea that the community's leadership could ever be anything but secular or could be in the nature of an 'apostolic succession'. But this was precisely what the Shia doctrine aimed at. It not only insisted - in clear contradiction to the spirit of Islam - on the principle of apostolic succession, but reserved that succession exclusively to 'tie Prophet's seed', that is, to his cousin and son-in-law Ali and his lineal descendants.

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

If Ali was the rightful heir and successor of the Prophet, the three Caliphs who preceded him must obviously have been usurpers - and among them had been Umar, that same Umar who had conquered Iran!

My son: if a woman holds the whole of her man's heart, he will not think of, nor need, marrying another. But if his heart is not entirely with her - will she gain anything by keeping him thus half-heartedly to herself alone?'

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

Islam recommends, to be sure, single marriages, but allows a man to marry up to four wives under exceptional circumstances. One might ask why the same latitude has not been given to woman as well; but the answer is simple. Notwithstanding the spiritual fact of love that has entered human life in the course of man's development, the underlying biological reason for the sexual urge is, in both sexes, procreation:

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

since marriage in Islam is not a sacrament but a civil contract - recourse to divorce is always open to either of the marriage partners, the more so as the stigma which elsewhere attaches to divorce with greater or lesser intensity is absent in Muslim society (with the possible exception of the Indian Muslims, who have been influenced in this respect by centuries of contact with Hindu society, in which divorce is utterly forbidden).

### Road to Mecca by Muhammad Asad

it considers adultery one of the most heinous of crimes: for in the face of such latitude, no emotional or sensual entanglement can ever serve as an excuse. It is true that in the centuries of Muslim decline, social custom has often made it difficult for a woman to exercise her prerogative of divorce as freely as the Law-Giver had intended: for this, however, not Islam but custom is to blame - just as custom, and not Islamic Law, is to be blamed for the seclusion in which woman has been kept for so long in so many Muslim countries: for neither in the Koran nor in the life-example of the Prophet do we find any warrant for this practice, which later found its way into Muslim society from Byzantium.

But those whose faith is strong would read what is written in letters of flame on his forehead: Denier of God - and thus they would know that he is but a deception to test man's faith...

Is not this parable, O Shaykh, a fitting description of modern technical civilization? It is "one-eyed": that is, it looks upon only one side of life - material progress - and is unaware of its spiritual side. With the help of its mechanical marvels it enables man to see and hear far beyond his natural ability, and to cover endless distances at an inconceivable speed. Its scientific knowledge causes "rain to fall and plants to grow" and uncovers unsuspected treasures from beneath the ground. Its medicine brings life to those who seem to have been doomed to death, while its wars and scientific horrors destroy life. And its material advancement is so powerful and so glittering that the weak in faith are coming to believe that it is a godhead in its own right;

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they thought of spreading the gospel of Christianity all over the world; but now that their religious ardour has cooled so much that they consider religion no more than soothing background music - allowed to accompany, but not to influence, 'real' life - they have begun to spread instead the materialistic gospel of the 'Western way of life': the belief that all human problems can be solved in factories, laboratories and on the desks of statisticians. And thus the Dajjal has come into his own...

it was necessarily the God of the Children of Israel. In the structure of Koranic thought, on the other hand, considerations of descent or tribal adherence had no place. Islam postulated a self-contained political community which cut across the conventional divisions of tribe and race. In this respect, Islam and Christianity might be said to have had the same aim: both advocated an international community of people united by their adherence to a common ideal; but whereas Christianity had contented itself with a mere moral advocacy of this principle and, by advising its followers to give Caesar his due, had restricted its universal appeal to the spiritual sphere, Islam unfolded before the world the vision of a political organization in which God-consciousness would be the mainspring of man's practical behaviour and the sole basis of all social institutions. Thus - fulfilling what Christianity had left unfulfilled - Islam inaugurated a new chapter in the development of man: the first instance of an open, ideological society in contrast with the closed, racially or geographically limited, societies of the past.

Because of Europe's long, almost exclusive association with Christianity, even the agnostic European had subconsciously learned to look upon all religious experience through the lens of Christian concepts, and would regard it as 'valid' only if it was accompanied by a thrill of numinous awe before things hidden and beyond intellectual comprehension. Islam did not fulfil this requirement: it insisted on a co-ordination of the physical and spiritual aspects of life on a perfectly natural plane.

Instead of basing his social revolution on a revived and reinvigorated Islam, Ataturk forsook the spiritual force of religion (which alone had brought him to victory) and made, quite unnecessarily, a rejection of all Islamic values the basis of his reforms. Unnecessarily even from Ataturk's viewpoint: for he could easily have harnessed the tremendous religious enthusiasm of his people to a positive drive for progress without cutting them adrift from all that had shaped their culture and made them a great race.

### Sirah of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) by Sheikh Yasir Qadhi

After the battle of Badr, a woman was informed that her whole family was killed, brother, uncle, husband. She kept asking if the Prophet Muhammad SAW was alive, when told yes, she said then that’s all I need.

### Sirah of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) by Sheikh Yasir Qadhi

The strength and courage of Ali RAH electing to be the champion in battles again and again despite his age, and coming out the winner.

### Sirah of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) by Sheikh Yasir Qadhi

Common criticism of the Prophet SAW being a “warlord” whereas all the battles were for sustenance ie the early ghazwahs (campaigns involving the Prophet SAW) where the Muslims were raiding the Quraish trading caravans. Later battles such as Badr and Khandaq were defensive battles.

### Sirah of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) by Sheikh Yasir Qadhi

The persecution of the early muslims stood out. Bilal RAH was tortured, placed under a heavy stone on the hot Arabian ground, strung and dragged through Mecca, yet still preached “One! One!” Referring to the tawhid of Allah.

### Sirah of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) by Sheikh Yasir Qadhi

Preparedness in this world is paramount. The treaty of Hudaybiyyah when the Prophet SAW went first to make umrah, he led the Muslims unarmed and in ihram, yet following the muslims was a caravan of their armor and weapons in case. Then they got to the valley of Hudabiyyah, they were ambushed, yet the Muslims were able to defend themselves, with no causalities on either side.

### ### Sirah of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) by Sheikh Yasir Qadhi

Common criticism again of the Prophet SAW was his treatment of the jews. The multiple Jewish tribes signed a treaty with the Prophet SAW shortly after making Hijra. On 3 separate occasions, the Jews conspired with the Quraish and other tribes to undermine the Muslims. Deserting in battle (Badr), allying with the Quraish (Khandaq), and causing social disharmony. In one instance, a Jewish man in the market cursed and forced the clothes off a Muslim woman for some argument (fact check!).

### Giftology by John Ruhlin

Gifts should be unexpected. Expected gifts make the receiver question the value, whereas unexpected gifts don’t have to be very expensive. For example, if I tell my wife “Honey I’m bringing pizza for dinner!” And she describes what she wants, 1 cheese 1 mushrooms pizza. I come home without the mushroom pizza, she’ll be disappointed. Whereas I unexpectedly come home with dinner, then who cares what I brought! This translates for business into not just giving gifts for Thanksgiving/Christmas, but also for unexpected holidays like valentines day (Love working with you!), or St Patricks day (lucky to be your agency!)

### Giftology by John Ruhlin

Gifts should be durable. One-time or consumable gifts have a lifespan that when they’re used, the gift giver is forgotten. Aim for things that have some long lived life cycle ie knives, or if the receiver is a golfer then maybe gloves or tees.

### Giftology by John Ruhlin

Gifts should be for the receiver, or ideally for THEIR inner circle. Don’t emblazon your company logo over a polo shirt and gift that. That’s a gift for you, not them. Instead, emblazon their name, or last name. Better yet, instead of doing a shirt, do a set of knives with their family name engraved, so that the person’s wife or husband will use the knives and remember who gave it to them.

Seeing oppressive power dynamics in every interaction is a religious, unfalsifiable belief. You either accept this as true because you’re a theorist, or you reject it because you want to further solidify your position of power.

Many tactics used by the modern left were used by Maoists in their takeover of Chinese society.

Big point - a lot of the wins we’ve seen in history have come from Enlightenment era, liberal thinking. Freedom from colonialism in India, so thinking of Ghandi, Nehru, Jinnah, Sheikh Mujib in Bangladesh, have all been trained on the classical liberalism idea of individual rights and universal access to things like freedom. Post colonialism came after the hard work was done, and supports a dumb idea that only white people believe in rationality. Feminists achieved a great deal of legal and economic equality on the basis of classical liberalism, showing that indeed there is no difference in intelligence between men and women.

### Answer to Modernism by Maulana Ashraf Ali Thanvi

The realms of knowledge are 2 categories - knowledge of the physical world, and that of values. Knowledge of this world is divided into 3 categories - metaphysics, mathematics, and physics. Knowledge of values is divided into 3 categories - ethics, domestic economy, and politics. These 6 categories of knowledge are bound by different aspects. Knowledge of values and metaphysics are not bound by the physical world nor by idealized logical constructs. Sharia is applied to these forms of knowledge. Mathematics is bound by idealized logical constructs. Physics is bound like math plus bound by the physical world. The nature and types of facts are discussed. Not all facts can be sensed and observed, and if not sensible then it is not permissible on this basis alone to deny it’s existence or truthiness. Denying facts determined on by a report from a truthful reporter with rational arguments is not permissible because these reports are unfalsifiable.

The medium is the message. The medium in which communication is being done dictates the content of that message. Subsequently, markers of intelligence follow based on the society’s prevailing medium of messaging. So in oratory cultures, concepts and lessons need to be memorizable so in early human history we see a proliferation of great poems, sayings, fables etc. In oratory cultures, an intelligent person can bring up several wise, timeless sayings to relate to the situation at hand. A typographical culture, which historically the US was an outlier in adopting widespread literacy, rational thought is forced on the population as to write something demands meaning to be conveyed. These cultures, markers of intelligence are rationality and logic. The author makes the claim that in our increasingly digital (dated by the book, so here he meant televised) culture, the medium cannot convey the same level of complex thought. The televised culture’s marker of intelligence is witty sayings, shallow, un-contextualized bits of information.

### 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing by Al Ries

On positioning - Marketing is all about playing against people’s perceptions, not products. What is the customers/users ladder rank of other competitors? How can I be different?

In strength there is weakness, can this be the source of our positioning?

### Crime and Punishment

"Though he does take bribes." "Well, he does! and what of it? I don't care if he does take bribes," Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability. "I don't praise him for taking bribes. I only say he is a nice man in his own way! But if one looks at men in all ways—are there many good ones left?

"What answer had your lecturer in Moscow to make to the question why he was forging notes? 'Everybody is getting rich one way or another, so I want to make haste to get rich too.' I don't remember the exact words, but the upshot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting or working!

### Crime and Punishment

The lodgers, one after another, squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden accident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, from which no living man is exempt, even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and compassion.

### Crime and Punishment

Although Pulcheria Alexandrovna was forty-three, her face still retained traces of her former beauty; she looked much younger than her age, indeed, which is almost always the case with women who retain serenity of spirit, sensitiveness and pure sincere warmth of heart to old age. We may add in parenthesis that to preserve all this is the only means of retaining beauty to old age.

### Crime and Punishment

"There is some truth in your observation," the latter replied. "In that sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with the slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for we must draw a line. A normal man, it is true, hardly exists. Among dozens—perhaps hundreds of thousands—hardly one is to be met with."

### Crime and Punishment

It is expressed again in legal jargon, that is to say, with a too obvious display of the aim, and with a very naïve eagerness. He is a man of intelligence, but to act sensibly, intelligence is not enough.

the socialist doctrine. You know their doctrine; crime is a protest against the abnormality of the social organisation and nothing more, and nothing more; no other causes admitted!..." "You are wrong there," cried Porfiry Petrovitch; he was noticeably animated and kept laughing as he looked at Razumihin, which made him more excited than ever. "Nothing is admitted," Razumihin interrupted with heat. "I am not wrong. I'll show you their pamphlets. Everything with them is 'the influence of environment,' and nothing else. Their favourite phrase! From which it follows that, if society is normally organised, all crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest against and all men will become righteous in one instant. Human nature is not taken into account, it is excluded, it's not supposed to exist! They don't recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living process, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant, quicker than any living process! That's why they instinctively dislike history, 'nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,' and they explain it all as stupidity! That's why they so dislike the living process of life; they don't want a living soul!

### Crime and Punishment

I simply hinted that an 'extraordinary' man has the right... that is not an official right, but an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep... certain obstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity).

### Crime and Punishment

Then, I remember, I maintain in my article that all... well, legislators and leaders of men, such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they transgressed the ancient one,

### Crime and Punishment

It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you, but because of your great suffering. But you are a great sinner, that's true," he added almost solemnly, "and your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing. Isn't that fearful? Isn't it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so, and at the same time you know yourself (you've only to open your eyes) that you are not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from anything?

### Crime and Punishment

These are special cases, I admit. But you must observe this, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, the general case, the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended, for which they are calculated and laid down in books, does not exist at all, for the reason that every case, every crime, for instance, so soon as it actually occurs, at once becomes a thoroughly special case and sometimes a case unlike any that's gone before.

### Crime and Punishment

my dear Rodion Romanovitch, you are a man still young, so to say, in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything, like all young people. Playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and that's for all the world like the old Austrian Hof-kriegsrath, as far as I can judge of military matters, that is: on paper they'd beaten Napoleon and taken him prisoner, and there in their study they worked it all out in the cleverest fashion, but look you, General Mack surrendered with all his army,

### Crime and Punishment

"Is that Terebyeva the one you said had made a third free marriage?" "No, it's only the second, really! But what if it were the fourth, what if it were the fifteenth, that's all nonsense!

### Crime and Punishment

As to Sofya Semyonovna personally, I regard her action as a vigorous protest against the organisation of society, and I respect her deeply for it; I rejoice indeed when I look at her!" "I was told that you got her turned out of these lodgings." Lebeziatnikov was enraged. "That's another slander," he yelled. "It was not so at all! That was all Katerina Ivanovna's invention, for she did not understand! And I never made love to Sofya Semyonovna! I was simply developing her, entirely disinterestedly, trying to rouse her to protest.... All I wanted was her protest and Sofya Semyonovna could not have remained here anyway!"

### Crime and Punishment

'More honourable,' 'nobler'—all those are old-fashioned prejudices which I reject. Everything which is of use to mankind is honourable. I only understand one word: useful! You can snigger as much as you like, but that's so!"

### Crime and Punishment

everyone has abandoned her, she will take the children and go into the street with a barrel-organ, and the children will sing and dance, and she too, and collect money, and will go every day under the general's window... 'to let everyone see well-born children, whose father was an official, begging in the street.' She keeps beating the children and they are all crying. She is teaching Lida to sing 'My Village,' the boy to dance, Polenka the same.

### Crime and Punishment

So a man will sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand, yet when the knife is at his throat at last, he feels no fear.

### Crime and Punishment

She assured Razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that his article and brilliant literary talent proved it. This article she was continually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed with her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though the subject was obviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken her suspicions.

### Crime and Punishment

He didn't understand that that consciousness might be the promise of a future crisis, of a new view of life and of his future resurrection.
